## General

The Classic Arcade Game clone Project is based on the popular Frogger game. 
The Classic Arcade Game Clone Project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree program "Front-End Web Developer". 
HTML5, CSS and JavaScript were used to build the project.

## Rules

The aim of the game is for the player to navigate his character from bottom to top across the board without colliding with the bugs. The player's character is not able to leave the field on any side.

The game is played as follows:

- The player's character starts in the middle of the lower board.
- By clicking the arrow keys (left, right, up, down), the player navigates his character across the board.
- If the player's character collides with a bug, an error message appears and the game resets. 
- If the player's character reaches the water at the top of the board, it is considered a victory. The game resets as well.

The game has no end and runs until the player no longer wants to play.
